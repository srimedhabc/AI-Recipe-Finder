# AI-Recipe-Finder
AI Recipe Finder Using Cloud Technologies


The goal of this project is to design and implement an intelligent recipe recommendation system using 
advanced AI and cloud technologies. The system aims to simplify the process of finding recipes by 
allowing users to input a list of ingredients they have on hand. Based on this input, the system 
dynamically generates or retrieves appropriate recipes. 
To achieve this, I leveraged several modern datacenter components, including Google Cloud Functions, 
Google Cloud Storage, Google Pub/Sub, and GPT-Neo for AI-based recipe generation. The project 
focuses on creating a scalable, serverless architecture that ensures fast and reliable responses to user 
queries. Additionally, I wanted to integrate multiple cloud services in a meaningful way to showcase a 
real-world application of distributed computing technologies. 
Software and Hardware Components 
Software Components 
1. Streamlit: A Python-based web framework used to create the user interface. It provides an 
interactive front-end where users input their ingredients and view recipes. 
2. GPT-Neo: An open-source language model used to dynamically generate creative and human
like recipes. 
3. Google Cloud Functions: A serverless compute platform used to process HTTP requests and 
retrieve recipes based on user input. 
4. Google Cloud Storage: A persistent storage service used to save generated recipes in .txt 
format. 
5. Google Pub/Sub: A messaging service used for asynchronous communication between 
different components. 
6. Python Libraries: Includes torch, transformers, requests, and other libraries essential for 
integrating AI and cloud services. 
Hardware Components 
1. Google Cloud Infrastructure: Hosted services for Cloud Functions, Storage, and Pub/Sub. 
2. Local Machine: Used for development, testing, and running the Streamlit application.
